Below is the interview process. 


1. First Technical Round: Coding Challenge (Duration: 2 hours)

 

Candidates are expected to take the sample test from the link below before attending the first round of interviews. We are using our own coding platform and this exercise is purely to get used to the coding platform for the first round. People who donâ€™t practice this sample problem could find it difficult during the coding contest.

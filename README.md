# interview-problems

here is a series of problems which i have faced during my placement campaign

if you wanna be judgemental,
its useless to judge someone who you think is vulnerable to you

go fight some bigger fish and it would improve you taking on someone bigger

otherwise please feel free to check out all my f\*ckups to satisfactory accomplishments

life is all about everything it has to offer,
no need to smile everyday, just smile when its needed

We all have a long way to go my friend.

I will smile when we reach 
:)

Yours
